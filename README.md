First Submission â€“ Class Design & Partial Implementation

The goal of this was to design the (Card, Board and Deck) classes and do partial implementation based on the UML.

What has been completed?

Card Class

Stores card suit and rank
Includes IsFaceCard() method and ToString() override

Deck Class

Initializes a full 52-card deck
Includes methods for shuffling and drawing cards


/////////
UML Design

Full UML is shown in uml.txt for (Card, Deck, Board, Game, and Player) classes
Includes attributes and method signatures

Partial Board Class

Class created with constructor
Some methods partially written

Next Steps:

Complete Board, Game, and Player class logic
Add move validation (sum to 11 or J, Q, K combo)
Implement game loop with win/loss check
Add user interaction (console-based for now)
